compiles with: make mush or make all
runs with: ./mush OR ./mush [scriptfile]


Limits:

Command line length: 512
Commands to a pipeline: 10
Arguments to a command: 10

My own limit:
Individual stage command line length: 128

(if line len is 512 and max args is 10, then technically 
it could have been length 52, but 128 is also a nice number)

mush quits on ^D or 'q'
